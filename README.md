Lab 1

Lab 1 is my attempt to complete the requirements of Lab 1 assignment. I was attempting to make a 2D game. In doing so, I completed the assignment instructions by having a main scene, which is the stars. I then had several sprites, one being a ship the player could control and another being a background, all within the main scene. I then added another node with the star background, and within it, I included a child node containing another starship sprite. As such, it's highly reusable as I can call that node whenever I need that exact background. Additionally, I added some player mechanics to the starship sprite as I wanted to test the engine.

Additionally, all assets were pulled from the folders I included. I took screenshots of some of them as the assets had many within one JPG. I credit the creators of the sprites by including the license for their work in their respective asset folders.
