# VideoGame-Labs
Video Game Design Class Labs

Lab 1
Lab 1 is my attemot to complete the requirements of the lab 1 assignment. I was attempting to make a 2D game similar to Flappy Birds. In doing so, I completed the assignment instructions by having a main scene, which is the stars. I then had several sprites one being a ship a player could control and another being another background all within the main scene. I then had another instance of the star scene, with a child as another sprite. I also added some code, which I will go into detail about in lab 2, but I first must refine what I have before I move on to lab 2.
