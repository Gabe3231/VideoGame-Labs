Video Game Design Class Labs

Lab 1
Lab 1 is my attempt to complete the requirements of the lab 1 assignment. I was attempting to make a 2D game similar to Flappy Birds. In doing so, I completed the assignment instructions by having a main scene, which is the stars. I then had several sprites one being a ship a player could control and another being another background all within the main scene. I then had another scene which contained the star background, with a child as another sprite. Addtionaly, I added some player mechanics to the starship sprite. I also added some code, which I will go into detail about in lab 2, but I first must refine what I have before I move on to lab 2.

Additionally, all assets were pulled from the folders I included. I took screenshots of some of them as the assets had many within one JPG. I credit the creators of the sprites by including the license for their work in their respective asset folders.

Lab 2
TBD
